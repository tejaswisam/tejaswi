<br>
Hi, I’m Tejaswi Samavedula — a final-year B.Tech student in Smart Manufacturing at IIITDM Kancheepuram with a passion for building intelligent hardware systems that seamlessly blend design, sensors, and embedded systems.

I specialize in end-to-end product prototyping, combining skills in CAD design, embedded development (ESP32, STM32, ROS2), and sensor integration to bring real-world ideas to life. I’m deeply drawn to hardware design, and I enjoy exploring cross-disciplinary projects — from electronics to mechanical systems — always with a hands-on, detail-oriented approach.

I focus on creating solutions that are both functional and user-centered. I'm driven by innovation, curiosity, and always on the lookout for opportunities to design smarter, better-engineered tools.
