# About Me
Passionate and results-driven individual, pursuing my BTech in Smart Manufacturing from IIITDM
Kancheepuram, focusing on robotics and control systems. I also serve as the Team Captain of Astra IIITDM, a student-led team that designs and builds UAVs (drones). I specialize in designing, developing, and optimizing high-performance robotics and AI systems with an analytical and design-based approach. I have a keen interest in Japanese culture and technology.
