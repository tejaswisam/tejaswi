Developed a Hostel & Mess Complaint Registration System application which automates the process of complaint registration for both hostel and mess for the student in IIITDM. It also has a complaint tracker and complaint history of a particular student which is based on the both hostel and mess complaint systems. Used MySQL as query language with PHP for backend and HTML/CSS for frontend.
