> :octicons-location-16: Developed at Team Astra, IIITDM Kancheepuram &nbsp;
> :material-calendar: Mar 2023 - Nov 2023 &nbsp;

## Introduction
This work was done as a part of Team Astra, for participation in SAE AeroTHON 2023 competition. I designed and fabricated the drone body based on competition requirements. The drone was made of 3D printed parts and supported by carbon fiber plates.
