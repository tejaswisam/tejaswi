# Research Work

My research interests include Aerial robotics and robot manipulators. My current reserach at ARISE Lab, IIITDM Kancheepuram under [Dr. Sanjeet Kumar Nayak](https://www.iiitdm.ac.in/people/faculty/sanjeetn@iiitdm.ac.in){:target="_blank"} from IIITDM, Kancheepuram is foucused on mapping and navigation of indoor environment using nano-drones, leading efficient and cost effective solutions. Looking forward to work and collaborate in field of robotics and mechatronics.

    This research explores cost-effective and efficient solution for indoor mapping using nano drones equipped with basic distance sensors. This work is based on mapper-follower architecture focusing on computational efficiency and autonomy for nano drones. This research is accepted in 17th International Conference on COMmunication Systems & NETworkS ([COMSNETS 2025 Demos & Exhibits](https://www.comsnets.org/demos_exhibits.html){:target="_blank"}).
