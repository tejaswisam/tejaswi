# Research Work

My research interests include intelligent systems design and robot manipulators. As a Reserach Intern at ARISE Lab, IIITDM Kancheepuram under [Dr. Sanjeet Kumar Nayak](https://www.iiitdm.ac.in/people/faculty/sanjeetn@iiitdm.ac.in){:target="_blank"} from IIITDM, Kancheepuram, I worked on a project with a focus on mapping and navigation of indoor environment using nano-drones, leading efficient and cost effective solutions.

This research explores cost-effective and efficient solution for indoor mapping using nano drones equipped with quad-ToF sensor. This work is based on mapper-follower architecture focusing on computational efficiency and autonomy for nano drones. This research is accepted in 17th International Conference on COMmunication Systems & NETworkS.
